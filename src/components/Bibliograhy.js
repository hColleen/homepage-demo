                <p>When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. I'm a water fanatic. I love water.</p>

                <p>We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. And maybe a little bush lives there. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy.</p>

                <p>Let's put a touch more of the magic here. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. It's all a game of angles. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner.</p>

                <p>We'll make some happy little bushes here. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Let's have a nice tree right here. We don't want to set these clouds on fire.</p>

                <p>It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. We need a shadow side and a highlight side.</p>

                <p>Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Let your imagination be your guide. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good.</p>

                <p>Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Let's do it again then, what the heck. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. We'll do another happy little painting. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too.</p>
